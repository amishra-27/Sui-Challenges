# My Sui Dev Journal

## Challenge 0

1. The download process was straightforward following documentation
2. I had the extension downloaded but I think the link on the notion website might be wrong
3. I accidently created more than one account and had to figure out how to set my active address
4. I used the CLI which gave me a link to the faucet UI
5. The commands worked normally and I was able to set up the package
6. Publishing was relatively simple but I had to remove the gas budget to make the publish comand work.

### Summary

The setup was straightforward and following the documentation while playing with the CLI made it pretty easy.

## Challenge 1

1. The repo was straightforward. I used Suiscan for the shared object which was a little tricky for me.
2. I created the bash file with some trial and error and eventually produced the Object ID of the flag.
3. I had to play around with the typescript a lot to clear up dependency/compatability issues. I was also a little confused
   about the bech32key at first. Eventually I landed on a working script that added the flag to my address objects.

### Summary

This was a trickier challenge with more individual work, looking at documentation for SUI, TS, etc. It was rewarding to finally create working bash and typescript scripts that produced the flags. 

### Deliverables

Object ID 1: 0xc60f6be3a87d8ecd171dc750d078dd025e9bc07521d2a2f38019243901795931

Object ID 2: 0x1a2839506853bc0a2f1b610c0acd9bc196b676efa361092c408c3bbb0b0daa2c
