# My Sui Dev Journal

## Challenge 0

1. The download process was straightforward following documentation
2. I had the extension downloaded but I think the link on the notion website might be wrong
3. I accidently created more than one account and had to figure out how to set my active address
4. I used the CLI which gave me a link to the faucet UI
5. The `sui move new` command worked fine but determine the path where the package was made was a little confusing at first.
6. Woah, so much easier than other chains!

### Summary

The setup was straightforward and following the documentation while playing with the CLI made it pretty easy.
